Voltage Checker, Uni Assignment 3

The brief for this assingment was to read in a voltage from an electrical substation once per hour for six hours. These voltages are then checked to display any voltages that differ from the average by more than 10% It also must display any pairs of consecutive hours where the change from the voltage at one hour to the next is greater than 15% of the average.

Judge Mark Average, Assignment 2

This was a university assignment that I recently completed.

Goal of the project was to have the user select a number a judges (between 4 and 8) with data validation and then enter the marks for x amount of judges - program then removes the lowest and highest element and displays the average result of the remaining marks.

Difference From Set Date, Assignment 1

This was a university assignment that was mainly used to test our knowledge of if statements.

This program will ask for a difference in days (both negative and positive)

It will then ask for a date, then do the calculation - it uses the if statements to factor in year changes, month changes and leap years affecting February - March.

I see now that I could have placed most of the calculations into functions or used loops but for this assignment it was not necessary.
